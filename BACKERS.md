The Jovo Framework is an Apache 2.0 licensed open source project and completely free to use. We spent more than 3 years investing time and money into building the framework and helping the Jovo community with support and tutorials.

If you run a business and are building on top of Jovo, it makes business sense to sponsor our development: it ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained. It can also help your exposure in the voice community, where Jovo is a recognized and respected brand.
